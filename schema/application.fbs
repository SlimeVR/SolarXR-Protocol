// IMPORTANT: We can only add to the *end* of a union or table in order to maintain
// compatibility. We also cannot delete fields of a table, only deprecate them.
//
// Also, an additional note that should be remembered: Vectors of unions are not
// yet supported in all languages, so we cannot use them in this schema.
//
// In some larger unions (such as `TrackerDataComponentU` and `DeviceDataComponentU`),
// the union variants are named both for convenience, and to disambiguate between
// multiple variants of the same type, for example two `Vec3f`s. Also, I had
// to wrap any scalar or list types in those unions in structs, because unions
// only support tables, structs, or strings. Luckily, this has no impact on the
// size of the flatbuffer.
//
// One other convention to be aware of: If a table is only there to wrap something
// trivially (such as a union or an enum), and I couldn't think of a better name,
// I append `W` for "wrapper" to it. LMK if you thing there is a better naming
// convention.


/// MessageBundle contains all of the messages for the data feed system and the

// The list of messages in one buffer instead of one message per buffer gives us
// the flexibility to bundle messages up - there will be mutliple data feeds at
// a time, and multiple requests at a time, potentially, so this handles that.
