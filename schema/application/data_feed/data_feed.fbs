/// This file contains types related to the data feed system. This allows sending
/// information about the device whether static or dynamic, to any application,
/// with a unified API.
///
/// The core datatype is `DataFeedUpdate`, which contains a table of optional fields,
/// representing all of the data about both physical and synthetic(software) devices.
/// There is a corresponding mask on those fields called `, which defaults to all
/// fields false, meaning no data.
///
/// It is important to note that the absence of a value in a serialized flatbuffer
/// binary corresponds to the default value in the schema, which means that only
/// fields that are actually populated have any impact on the bandwidth of data
/// used by flatbuffer messages. This allows us to lump basically all fields that
/// could possibly be needed into `DeviceStatus` or `TrackerStatus`, without
/// impacting performance.
///
/// There are two ways of getting `DataFeedUpdate`s - one way is by requesting a single
/// update, via `PollDataFeed`. Another way is by requesting a persistent data feed via
/// a `DataFeedRequest`, which itself is simply a list of `DataFeedConfig`s, one for
/// each data feed that is being requested.
///
/// `DataFeedConfig` allows fine grained control over the type of data sent (via
/// `DeviceStatusMask` ), and the frequency of that data.
