/// Pub/Sub protocol.
///
/// This protocol provides the pub-sub messaging pattern. This pattern is better suited
/// to communication between multiple applications because apps may have various
/// versions, are non-standardized, and may or may not be present. Unlike
/// Request/Response, no transactional state is needed on the server, and the meaning
/// of payloads can be determined in a decentralized manner via the topic system.
///
/// Solar-XR still provides provides discovery and routing of the message, but the
/// actual message payload is application specific, and Solar-XR makes few if any
/// assumptions on its meaning.
///
/// Example use case:
/// SlimeVR overlay has a visibility toggle, and the SlimeVR gui wishes to allow users
/// to control this in its GUI. So the GUI sends a key-value pair to the "settings"
/// topic of the SlimeVR overlay. The SlimeVR server will use this topic identifier to
/// forward the message payload to any application that is subscribed to that topic.
/// The server doesn't understand the meaning of the payload - all it sees is the topic
/// id, and the key-value pairs. The state of the overlay visibility isn't even held in
/// the server at all - all of that is maintained by the vr overlay application.
