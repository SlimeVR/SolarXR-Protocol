# C++ protocol

These files were generated with the following `flatc` command:

```
flatc --scoped-enums --cpp *.fbs
```
Where the * was filled in with each filename. Then the files are placed in the `include/solarxr_protocol/generated` folder.

`--scoped-enums` is used because C++11 style enums are much more ergonomic :)
